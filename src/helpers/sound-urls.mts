/**

 * Short pre-recorded FLAC clips played on the satellite speaker to give the user

 * Served straight from the repo's `.sounds/` folder on GitHub (raw `main` URLs).
 * Keep every clip provider-agnostic — the app supports OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral
 * and a local pipeline, so no message should name a specific vendor. See
 * `.sounds/README.md` for the catalogue and re-recording notes.
