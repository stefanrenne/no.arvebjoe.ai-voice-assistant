/**
 * Provider-agnostic voice/LLM abstraction.
 *
 * `IVoiceProvider` is the seam between the device (`voice-assistant-device.mts`)
 * and a concrete backend. The contract is deliberately backend-neutral: a provider
 * can be a single realtime speech-in / speech-out WebSocket (OpenAI Realtime,
 * Gemini Live) or a composed pipeline (the local/custom pipeline and its Mistral
 * subclass: VAD -> STT -> LLM -> TTS), possibly mixing WebSocket and slower REST
 * transports internally. `voice-provider-factory.mts` picks the implementation
 * from the `voice_provider` global setting.
 *
 * The device treats the provider as a black box: it pushes microphone PCM in and
 * receives audio/text + tool calls out, plus lifecycle and on-the-fly settings updates.
 *
 * AUDIO CONTRACTS (current, provider-independent — keep these in sync if generalized):
 *   - `sendAudioChunk()` expects PCM16, mono, 24 kHz (the device resamples 16k->24k first).
 *   - `audio.delta` emits PCM16, mono, 24 kHz (the device segments then FLAC-encodes it).
 *   - `textToSpeech()` returns a FLAC-encoded buffer.
 * A future 16 kHz local pipeline would require device-side resample/encode changes.
