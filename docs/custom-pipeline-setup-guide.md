# Custom pipeline — setup guide for every stage

The **Custom pipeline** (the `local` voice provider) chains three independent stages:

```
mic audio ─▶ STT (speech-to-text) ─▶ LLM (language model) ─▶ TTS (text-to-speech) ─▶ speaker
```

Each stage is **pluggable and mixed independently**, so a valid setup can be all-local
(Whisper + Ollama + Piper), all-cloud (Voxtral + Mistral + Voxtral), or anything in
between (e.g. local Whisper → cloud Mistral LLM → local Piper). Voice-activity detection
runs **in the app on the Homey** — there is no server VAD to configure locally.

This guide gives a working recipe for **every backend of every stage**, with Docker
Compose where a server is involved and desktop-app instructions for Ollama and LM Studio.

---

## Before you start — the one gotcha that trips everyone

**Your Homey is a separate box on the network.** When you type a *Host* into the Custom
pipeline settings, it is the Homey — not your PC — that connects to it. So:

- **Never use `localhost` / `127.0.0.1`** in the settings. Use the **LAN IP** of the machine
  running the server, e.g. `192.168.1.50`. (A hostname works only if your Homey can resolve it.)
- The server must **listen on all interfaces**, not just loopback. In Docker this is the
  default once you publish a port (`ports:`); for the Ollama/LM Studio desktop apps it is an
  explicit toggle (below).
- The host's **firewall** must allow the port from your LAN.

Every "Test" button on the settings page fires a *real* mini-request from the Homey, so a
wrong IP, port, model or key shows up immediately with the actual error and latency. Use them.

## Fast reference — which setting each backend uses

| Stage | Backend (dropdown) | Settings you fill in | Default port |
|---|---|---|---|
| **STT** | Whisper — HTTP (local) | Host, Port | 9000 |
| | Wyoming — faster-whisper (local) | Host, Port | 10300 |
| | Mistral Voxtral (cloud) | Mistral API key, Model | — |
| | Mistral Voxtral Realtime (cloud) | Mistral API key, Model | — |
| | OpenAI-compatible (cloud/custom) | Server (preset or custom URL), API key, Model | — |
| **LLM** | Ollama (local) | Host, Port, Model, Context window | 11434 |
| | LM Studio (local) | Host, Port, Model | 1234 |
| | Mistral (cloud) | Mistral API key, Model | — |
| | Claude — Anthropic (cloud) | Anthropic API key, Model (dropdown, live) | — |
| | OpenAI-compatible (cloud/custom) | Server (preset or custom URL), API key, Model | — |
| **TTS** | Piper — HTTP (local) | Host, Port | 5000 |
| | Wyoming — Piper (local) | Host, Port | 10200 |
| | Mistral Voxtral (cloud) | Mistral API key, Model, Voice | — |
| | OpenAI-compatible (cloud/custom) | Server (preset or custom URL), API key, Model, Voice override | — |

All Mistral-backed stages share the **one** `Mistral API key` field at the top of the
Custom pipeline section.

---

## The recommended fully-local stack (copy-paste)

This single Compose file gives you all three local stages at once: Whisper (STT) + Ollama
(LLM) + Piper (TTS). It's the fastest way to a 100%-private assistant. Put it in a file
called `docker-compose.yml` on the machine that will host the services (a NAS, a mini-PC,
a spare desktop), then `docker compose up -d`.

```yaml
services:
  # ── Speech-to-text: whisper-asr-webservice (port 9000) ──────────────
  whisper:
    image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      ASR_MODEL: base            # tiny | base | small | medium | large-v3
      ASR_ENGINE: faster_whisper # fast CPU/GPU engine
    volumes:
      - whisper-cache:/root/.cache
    restart: unless-stopped

  # ── Language model: Ollama (port 11434) ─────────────────────────────
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama:/root/.ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
    # For NVIDIA GPU, uncomment:
    # deploy:
    #   resources:
    #     reservations:
    #       devices:
    #         - driver: nvidia
    #           count: all
    #           capabilities: [gpu]

  # ── Text-to-speech: Piper HTTP (port 5000) ──────────────────────────
  piper:
    image: artibex/piper-http:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      # Pick any Piper voice: https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/VOICES.md
      PIPER_VOICE: en_US-lessac-medium
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  whisper-cache:
  ollama:
```

After it's up, pull a tool-calling model into Ollama once:

```bash
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

Then in the app (Settings → **Custom pipeline**), with the host IP as `192.168.1.50`:

| Stage | Backend | Host | Port | Model |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STT | Whisper — HTTP | `192.168.1.50` | `9000` | — |
| LLM | Ollama | `192.168.1.50` | `11434` | `qwen3:8b` |
| TTS | Piper — HTTP | `192.168.1.50` | `5000` | — |

Hit each **Test** button, then **Save**. Done.

The rest of this guide covers every alternative for each stage.

---

## Stage 1 — Speech-to-text (STT)

### 1a. Whisper over HTTP *(local, default)*

The app auto-detects the three common Whisper HTTP flavors — you don't choose one, just
point it at the server and it figures out the dialect on the first request:

| Server | Endpoint style | Typical port |
|---|---|---|
| `onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice` | `/asr` | 9000 |
| speaches / faster-whisper-server / LocalAI | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | 8000 |
| whisper.cpp server | `/inference` | 8080 |

**whisper-asr-webservice (recommended — matches the default port 9000):**

```yaml
services:
  whisper:
    image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      ASR_MODEL: base            # tiny/base = fast; small/medium = more accurate
      ASR_ENGINE: faster_whisper
    volumes:
      - whisper-cache:/root/.cache
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  whisper-cache:
```

**speaches (OpenAI-dialect Whisper, also works here):**

```yaml
services:
  speaches:
    image: ghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest-cpu   # or :latest-cuda for NVIDIA
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - speaches:/home/ubuntu/.cache/huggingface
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  speaches:
```

> Settings for speaches: STT backend = **Whisper — HTTP**, Host = your LAN IP, **Port = 8000**
> (the app detects the `/v1/audio/transcriptions` style automatically). You could also use the
> **OpenAI-compatible** STT backend instead with Base URL `http://192.168.1.50:8000/v1`.

**Settings:** STT backend = **Whisper — HTTP (local)**, Host = LAN IP, Port = the server's
port. No authentication — keep it on a trusted LAN.

---

### 1b. Wyoming faster-whisper *(local, Home Assistant ecosystem)*

Raw-TCP Wyoming protocol (not HTTP) — the same `rhasspy/wyoming-whisper` image Home Assistant
uses. The model and language are whatever the server was started with.

```yaml
services:
  wyoming-whisper:
    image: rhasspy/wyoming-whisper:latest
    command: --model base --language en
    ports:
      - "10300:10300"
    volumes:
      - whisper-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  whisper-data:
```

**Settings:** STT backend = **Wyoming — faster-whisper (local)**, Host = LAN IP, Port = `10300`.

---

### 1c. Mistral Voxtral *(cloud, batch)*

No server to run — Mistral transcribes in the cloud. Your voice clips are sent to Mistral.

1. Get a key at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai) and paste it into the single
   **Mistral API key** field.
2. STT backend = **Mistral Voxtral (cloud API)**.
3. Model — leave empty for `voxtral-mini-latest`, or pin another id.

---

### 1d. Mistral Voxtral Realtime *(cloud, streaming websocket)*

Same key, but a streaming transcription websocket (sub-500 ms) — the transcript is ready the
moment you stop talking.

- STT backend = **Mistral Voxtral Realtime (cloud, streaming)**.
- Model — empty = `voxtral-mini-transcribe-realtime-2602`.

---

### 1e. OpenAI-compatible STT *(cloud or custom server)*

Anything speaking OpenAI's `/audio/transcriptions` API: OpenAI itself, Groq, speaches, etc.

The **Server** dropdown does the typing for you — pick a cloud service and its base URL and a
known-good model are filled in, leaving only the API key (with a link to where you get one). The
Base URL field only appears for **Custom / self-hosted**, where a bare host gets `/v1` appended
automatically.

**OpenAI (cloud):** Server = **OpenAI** → Model `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` (or `gpt-4o-transcribe`,
`whisper-1`). Already using the OpenAI Realtime engine? **Use my OpenAI key from General** copies
the key you already saved.

**Groq (very fast, cloud):** Server = **Groq** → Model `whisper-large-v3-turbo`, plus your Groq
key from [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys).

**Keyless local server:** Server = **Custom / self-hosted**, leave the API key empty and point
Base URL at your LAN server (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8000/v1`).

---

## Stage 2 — Language model (LLM)

The LLM must support **tool calling** — that's how the assistant controls your home. Pick a
tool-calling model or the assistant can't do anything.

### 2a. Ollama *(local, default)*

**As a Docker service:**

```yaml
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama:/root/.ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  ollama:
```

Pull a tool-calling model once:

```bash
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull qwen3:8b
# other good choices: llama3.1, gpt-oss, mistral-nemo
```

**As the Ollama desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux):** by default it listens on
`127.0.0.1` only, which your Homey **cannot** reach. Make it listen on the LAN:

- **macOS/Windows:** set the environment variable `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` and restart Ollama.
  (macOS: `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"` then restart the app; Windows: add
  `OLLAMA_HOST = 0.0.0.0` under *System → Environment Variables* and restart.)
- Allow port `11434` through the machine's firewall.

**Settings:** LLM backend = **Ollama**, Host = LAN IP, Port = `11434`, Model = e.g. `qwen3:8b`
(empty = first installed model). Leave **Context window (num_ctx)** at `8192` — Ollama's own
default (4096) is too small for the assistant's instructions and it silently truncates them.

---

### 2b. LM Studio *(local desktop app)*

1. Open LM Studio → download a **tool-calling** model (e.g. Qwen2.5-Instruct, Llama-3.1-Instruct).
2. Go to the **Developer** tab (the terminal icon), load the model, and **Start Server**.
3. Enable **"Serve on Local Network"** so the Homey can reach it (otherwise it binds to
   localhost only). Default port `1234`.

**Settings:** LLM backend = **LM Studio**, Host = LAN IP, Port = `1234`, Model — leave empty to
use whatever model is loaded, or type its id. The app reads LM Studio's configured context
window back live, so the token-budget bar in settings tells you if everything fits.

---

### 2c. Mistral *(cloud)*

- LLM backend = **Mistral (cloud API)**, same shared Mistral key.
- Model — empty = `mistral-small-latest`; any tool-calling Mistral model works
  (`mistral-medium-latest`, `mistral-large-latest`). Only the conversation text goes to Mistral.

---

### 2d. Claude *(Anthropic, cloud)*

Anthropic's Claude speaks its own Messages API (not the OpenAI dialect), so it has its own
backend rather than going through 2e.

1. Get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and paste it into the
   **Anthropic API key** field that appears under this backend.
2. LLM backend = **Claude — Anthropic (cloud API)**.
3. Model — the dropdown fills itself from `GET /v1/models` once the key is in, so it lists
   exactly what your account can use (leave it on **Default** for `claude-opus-5`). For voice,
   `claude-haiku-4-5` answers fastest and costs least; `claude-sonnet-5` sits in between. Every
   current Claude model does tool calling, so smart-home control works on all of them. If the
   list can't be loaded (no key yet, no internet, key rejected) the reason appears under the
   dropdown and any model you already saved stays selected.

Only the conversation text goes to Anthropic — with a local Whisper and a local Piper around it,
the audio still never leaves your LAN.

---

### 2e. OpenAI-compatible LLM *(cloud or custom server)*

Any server speaking OpenAI's `/chat/completions` **with tool calling**. Model is **required**
here. The **Server** dropdown fills in the base URL and a starting model for the cloud services;
**Custom / self-hosted** shows the Base URL field, where a bare host gets `/v1` appended.

**Cloud, from the Server dropdown:**

- **OpenAI** → `gpt-5-mini` · **Groq** → `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` ·
  **OpenRouter** → `openai/gpt-4o-mini` · **DeepSeek** → `deepseek-chat`
- Each fills its own base URL and links to where its key comes from; swap the model for any other
  tool-calling model that service offers.

**Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers** — llama.cpp, vLLM, or the Jan desktop app all work
through this backend:

```yaml
# llama.cpp server (OpenAI-compatible at /v1)
services:
  llamacpp:
    image: ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models
    command: >
      -m /models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf
      --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --jinja
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```yaml
# vLLM (OpenAI-compatible at /v1, NVIDIA GPU)
services:
  vllm:
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    command: >
      --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
      --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu]
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> **Jan desktop app:** enable its local API server (Settings → Local API Server), default port
> `1337`. Then LLM backend = **OpenAI-compatible**, Server = **Custom / self-hosted**,
> Base URL = `http://192.168.1.50:1337/v1`,
> no key, Model = the loaded model id. Make sure the chosen model supports tools.

For all of these: Server = **Custom / self-hosted**, Base URL = `http://<LAN-IP>:<port>/v1`,
API key empty (keyless local), Model = the served model id. `--jinja` (llama.cpp) / `--enable-auto-tool-choice` (vLLM) are what
turn on tool calling — without them the assistant can't control the home.

---

## Stage 3 — Text-to-speech (TTS)

### 3a. Piper over HTTP *(local, default)*

The app auto-detects Piper's `/synthesize` and `/` request shapes. The spoken voice is the
model the server was started with.

**artibex/piper-http (recommended — default port 5000):**

```yaml
services:
  piper:
    image: artibex/piper-http:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      PIPER_VOICE: en_US-lessac-medium   # see VOICES.md for the full list
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Pick a voice for your language from the
[Piper VOICES list](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/VOICES.md) (e.g.
`no_NO-talesyntese-medium`, `de_DE-thorsten-medium`). If the server exposes `GET /voices`, the
app can pass a per-request voice from the **Voice** dropdown in General; otherwise it uses the
server's default voice.

**Settings:** TTS backend = **Piper — HTTP (local)**, Host = LAN IP, Port = `5000`.

---

### 3b. Wyoming Piper *(local, Home Assistant ecosystem)*

The `rhasspy/wyoming-piper` image (raw TCP, port 10200). The voice is whatever the server was
started with.

```yaml
services:
  wyoming-piper:
    image: rhasspy/wyoming-piper:latest
    command: --voice en_US-lessac-medium
    ports:
      - "10200:10200"
    volumes:
      - piper-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  piper-data:
```

**Settings:** TTS backend = **Wyoming — Piper (local)**, Host = LAN IP, Port = `10200`.

---

### 3c. Mistral Voxtral TTS *(cloud)*

- TTS backend = **Mistral Voxtral (cloud API)**, shared Mistral key.
- Model — empty = `voxtral-mini-tts-2603`.
- **Voice:** save the Mistral key first, then the **Voice** dropdown in General fills in with
  Mistral's live voice library on Save — pick one there. (Voxtral voices are UUIDs fetched from
  Mistral; the open-weights preset names don't work against the live API.)

---

### 3d. OpenAI-compatible TTS *(cloud or custom server)*

Any server speaking OpenAI's `/audio/speech` API. A bare host gets `/v1` appended.

**Kokoro (local, self-hosted, free):**

```yaml
services:
  kokoro:
    image: ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:latest   # or -gpu for NVIDIA
    ports:
      - "8880:8880"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

- TTS backend = **OpenAI-compatible**, Server = **Custom / self-hosted**, Base URL =
  `http://192.168.1.50:8880/v1`, API key empty, Model = `kokoro`, **Voice override** = e.g.
  `af_heart` (Kokoro's voices aren't OpenAI's, so type the name in the override field — it wins
  over the General dropdown).

**OpenAI (cloud):**

- Server = **OpenAI** (base URL and Model `gpt-4o-mini-tts` are filled in), add your OpenAI key —
  or click **Use my OpenAI key from General** — and pick a standard voice (Alloy, Nova, …) in the
  **Voice** dropdown in General, leaving the override empty.

---

## Putting it together — some proven combinations

| Goal | STT | LLM | TTS |
|---|---|---|---|
| **100% private, no cloud** | Whisper HTTP | Ollama (`qwen3:8b`) | Piper HTTP |
| **Home Assistant boxes reused** | Wyoming faster-whisper | Ollama or LM Studio | Wyoming Piper |
| **Best local quality, some cloud** | Whisper HTTP | Mistral / Groq (cloud) | Piper HTTP |
| **Lowest latency, all cloud** | Voxtral Realtime | Groq or Mistral | Voxtral / OpenAI |
| **Desktop-app only, no Docker** | (cloud STT) | Ollama or LM Studio desktop | (cloud TTS) |

You can change any single stage without touching the others — the app rebuilds only the stage
whose settings changed and re-runs its health check.

---

## Networking & troubleshooting checklist

- **"Not connected" / timeout on Test** → wrong IP or port, or the server binds to loopback.
  Confirm from another machine: `curl http://<LAN-IP>:<port>/` should answer. For the Ollama
  desktop app, set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`; for LM Studio, enable *Serve on Local Network*.
- **Firewall** → open the port to your LAN on the host machine.
- **STT works, but the assistant does nothing** → the LLM model doesn't support tool calling.
  Switch to a tool-calling model (Qwen2.5/3, Llama-3.1, gpt-oss, Mistral) and, for
  llama.cpp/vLLM, enable the tool-call flags shown above.
- **Model "forgets" its rules on Ollama** → context window too small. Keep **num_ctx** at 8192+.
- **Wrong / silent voice** → the voice id isn't installed on the Piper server, or (Voxtral) the
  key wasn't saved before picking a voice. Re-save, then choose from the refreshed dropdown.
- **GPU** → uncomment the `deploy.resources` block (NVIDIA) for Whisper/Ollama/vLLM to cut
  latency dramatically; CPU works but is slower on larger models.

Use the per-stage **Test** buttons after every change — they report the real error and the
round-trip latency straight from your Homey.
```
